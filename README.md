# Wizardry: Dimguil English translation

An English translation patch for Wizardry: Dimguil, the 2000 PlayStation release
(SLPS-02691). It targets the Rev 1 disc only.

All the text a player can reach is in English now: the town, the castle and its menus,
the dungeon dialogue, combat, item and monster descriptions and the card game. It's a
beta. Much of the text is still being reviewed, and nobody has played it through to the
ending yet. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's left.

The patch is on the
[Releases](https://github.com/satelliteoflove/dimguil-patcher/releases) page. It applies
to the Track 1 `.bin` of a redump-style Rev 1 set, and the readme in the zip has the
steps. If something looks wrong or breaks, please open an issue.

## Credits

This started as Remisse's [dimguil-patcher](https://github.com/remii7/dimguil-patcher),
which dumps and reinserts the game's text and adds variable-width font support.
Vennobennu translated the event script and much of the menu, status and combat text,
and giblet92 edited it. Their work is still in here, and the git history keeps
Remisse's commits as they made them.

I picked it up from there and carried on with the rest of the translation and the
engine work it needed.

## Building it yourself

See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md). You'll need your own Rev 1 disc image.

## What's where

- `translations/` holds the English text, one JSON file per game file. `binary/` holds
  patches to non-text data (NPC party names).
- `asm/` has the armips patches: Remisse's VWF hacks in `vwf.asm`, and the rest built
  on top of them.
- `src/` is Remisse's Kotlin dumper and encoder. `sections.json` tells it where the
  text sits in each file, and `tables/` has the character tables.
- `graphics/` has the edited font sheet.
- `scripts/` has the build, a headless emulator harness built on the Beetle PSX
  libretro core (`emu.py`), and the checkers and viewers used while translating.
- `docs/` has notes on the engine, the translation and the review work, plus
  Remisse's original notes in `findings.md`.

The text is compressed by packing common letter pairs into single bytes. If you add or
change a digraph, the font sheet, `tables/compression.tbl` and the VWF width table in
`asm/vwf.asm` all have to agree.
